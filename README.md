# hello-world
I am following the tutorial on the github website

This is a short tutorial, avaialble on the github webiste, no coding is necesary, also you do not need to install or configure anyhitng on your computer.
All the steps are done via a browser.
Cool ha?

or maybe not so cool, depends on who you ask.
I am a bit old school, so I am not so sure this is quite cool, but maybe I can see it from a different point of view.
